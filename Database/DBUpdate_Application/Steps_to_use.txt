Step 1 : Run 'DB_Script.sql' into SSMS.
This must create 3 new database (CPHackathon, DmartHackathon and HackathornDataLake)
Then create Table in all the 3 dataabse and load some sample data under CPHackathon and DmartHackathon database.
For demo purpose we will manually insert data but in real world it is expected to get data from POS/Ecommerce

Step 2 : Run DataLoadintoDataLake.exe to load data into DataLake (HackathornDataLake database)
This Application is created in Delphi
Prerequisite is we must keep 'DataLoadintoDataLake.exe' and 'ConnectingString.ini' in same folder.
On douple click on the exe it will open a new screen and that screen has button. On click of that button application will search that if there are any SALES data available in CPHackathon/DmartHackathon database that is not present in HackathornDataLake it will copy.
